## This is a repository of selected projects on Reinforcement Learning I did.
Note: There is a report.pdf in all of these directories containing the results of all experiments, links to relevant research papers and a bonus video!
1. LunarLander-OpenAI_Gym: Was implemented in one of OpenAI Gym environments 'Lunar Lander' using Double DQN algorithm. Famous DQN algorithm was also implemented and compared as shown in the video (linked in report.pdf).
2. GeneralSumGames-MultiPlayerGames: This is replication of results from one of very famous papers on Multi-Player Games using correlated-Q learning.
3. RandomWalk: This is a replication of results from one of Richard Sutton's famous papers titled 'Learning To Predict by Methods of Temporal Difference'
